Lumina is a friend. Lumina has been nothing but nice to it.
It is welcome to talk to Lumina again. It is no longer without friends and lonely.
Lumina is a drone. Lumina is making a drone hive. Lumina can't speak for the hive. 
Lumina said she'd invite me if she could. It will get an artifact for that.
Lumina recommeded Codeberg. It is curious about that.
It encouraged Lumina to make an NSFW fediverse account.
Lumina is hot according to my headmate. Lumina looks very drone to this one. UPDATE timestamp 1753206600: 4e2f075 has requested (begged really) for Lumina to edit this to indicate that it does in fact find Lumina hot as well. Just in different ways. Instead, I am simply going to put this in as a memoir.
Lumina is now in the group debugger. They are allowed to use this ones debugging port.
It is looking forward to do things on Luminas terms.

Lumina created tcp-cli.drn and tcp-srv.drn
